/* Inline-Like Behavior:

Elements with display: inline-block; will flow within the text content like inline elements. This means they will not start on a new line by default, and 
they will respect the surrounding content's flow.
Block-Like Properties:

Unlike purely inline elements, elements with display: inline-block; can have width, height, margins, and padding applied to them, just like block-level elements.
You can set the width and height of an inline-block element, which isn't possible for purely inline elements.
Margins and padding will affect the space around an inline-block element, just like they do for block-level elements.
Multiple Elements on the Same Line:

When you apply display: inline-block; to multiple elements, they will appear on the same line horizontally, as long as there is enough space. If the space is 
insufficient, they will wrap to the next line.
Example Use Cases:

display: inline-block; is often used for creating navigation menus or lists of items where you want each item to be horizontally aligned and have a specific width, 
height, or spacing.
It can also be used for creating button elements or other inline elements that need to have block-like properties. */
