/* transition: This property is used to specify the transition effect for one or more CSS properties.
all: It specifies that the transition effect should apply to all CSS properties that are changing. In other words, it applies the same transition duration and
timing function to all properties that change.
1s: This is the duration of the transition effect, and it's measured in seconds. In this case, it's set to 1 second. This means that when a CSS property changes,
it will take 1 second to smoothly transition from its previous state to its new state. */
